# Shopping With Friends
Project 2 - Group 9
A Shopping Helper Program for the Holidays that allows users to create their shopping list, and and save the research they do into each item.  The users will also be able to view other members list items and the research they have done into the items, and add them as they want to their own list.  It gives the users the ability to set their budget and calculate the overall costs.  It gives the users a place to store their list and their research and compare it with others.
